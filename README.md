# Ender Dragon Slayer

This is a project idea originally from FreeCodeCamp. Mods and redesign are by me. I've also expanded some of the functionality to include music, a background image, media player and made the game more responsive so it can be played on most screen sizes.

# Version Alpha (latest)

-This version includes the base game and main title music. This is in development currently so any feedback is appretiated and can be left at "Issues". Gameplay is fully functional and working. The game's style is subject to change in future versions.

# Future ideas

In the future there will be fight/boss music and location images.
There will be a link to the soundtrack and artists who helped provided the amazing soundtrack.
