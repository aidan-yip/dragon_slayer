# Perilous Quest

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f312c3e8-98b6-4e22-ac50-3296bf34db80/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/perilous-quest/deploys)

This is a project idea originally from FreeCodeCamp. Mods and redesign are by me. I've also expanded some of the functionality to include music, a background image, media player and made the game more responsive so it can be played on most screen sizes.

# Version Alpha (latest)

This version includes the base game and main title music. This is in development currently so any feedback is appreciated and can be left at "Issues". Gameplay is fully functional and working. The game's style is subject to change in future versions.

# Credits

Original project idea by FreeCodeCamp - Mods and redesign by Aidan Y. / - Music ðŸŽ§ "Lovely Town" by  Skremzy (Tristan Forrest) / - "Boss Theme" by Audiophobia (Tanner Marsh) / - "Shop" and "Cave Tune" by Newave Oceans (Ade Y.).

# Future ideas

In the future there will be cave and secret game music. Location images to be added in a future release. There will be a link to the soundtrack and artists who helped provided the amazing soundtrack. Older versions may remain available for download as they are released.
