## dragon_slayer

This is a project idea originally from FreeCodeCamp. Mods and redesign are by me. I've also expanded some of the functionality to include music and made the game more responsive so it can be played on most screen sizes.

# Version Alpha v0.1.0

-This version includes the base game and main title music. 
-This is in development currently so any feedback is appretiated and can be left at "Issues". 
-Gameplay is fully functional and working. 
-The game's style is subject to change in future versions. Older versions will remain avalible for download as they are released.

There will be a link to the soundtrack and artists who helped provided the amazing soundtrack.
